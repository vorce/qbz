# QBZ

QBZ is a free and open source (FOSS) Qobuz client for Linux with native, high-fidelity playback. It is a real desktop application, not a web wrapper, so it can use DAC passthrough, preserve hi-res sample rates end-to-end, and deliver bit-perfect audio.

## Why QBZ

Browsers cap audio output around 48 kHz, while Qobuz streams up to 192 kHz. QBZ uses a native playback pipeline with direct device control so your system and DAC receive the original resolution, with caching and system integrations that wrappers cannot provide.

## Screenshots

Coming soon.

## Features

### Streaming and Playback
- Qobuz authentication and full catalog search (albums, tracks, artists, playlists).
- Native decoding for FLAC and MP3 with real-time playback state updates.
- Quality selection with automatic fallback across Qobuz tiers.
- Audio device enumeration and per-device output selection.
- DAC passthrough mode for bit-perfect playback.
- Gapless-ready playback pipeline with precise position tracking.

### Queue and Library
- Queue management with shuffle, repeat, and history navigation.
- In-memory audio cache with LRU eviction and next-track prefetching.
- Favorites and playlists from your Qobuz account.
- Local library backend: directory scanning, metadata extraction, CUE sheet parsing, and SQLite indexing.

### Integrations
- MPRIS media controls and media key support on Linux.
- Desktop notifications for track changes.
- Last.fm scrobbling and now-playing updates.
- Shareable Qobuz URLs and universal SongLink links (Odesli).

### Interface
- Now playing, queue panel, and full-screen playback views.
- Focus mode for distraction-free listening.
- English and Spanish localization.

## Open Source

QBZ is MIT-licensed and fully open source. No telemetry, no lock-in, and no hidden services. Just a clean, transparent player built for Linux audio fans.

## Inspiration

QBZ draws inspiration from projects like qobuz-dl, and from the broader Linux audio community that values open tools and high-fidelity playback.

## Tech Stack

- **Desktop:** Rust + Tauri 2
- **Frontend:** SvelteKit + TypeScript + Vite
- **Audio:** rodio + symphonia
- **Networking:** reqwest
- **Local library:** walkdir + lofty + rusqlite
- **Integrations:** souvlaki (MPRIS), notify-rust, SongLink (Odesli)
- **UX:** svelte-i18n, lucide-svelte

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable)
- Node.js 18+
- Linux with audio support (PipeWire, ALSA, or PulseAudio)

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri build
```

### Environment Variables (Building from Source Only)

> **Note:** If you're using pre-built binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/vicrodh/qbz/releases) page, Last.fm integration is already configured and ready to use. The following instructions are only for developers building from source.

Copy the example environment file and configure it with your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Last.fm Integration

To enable Last.fm scrobbling when building from source, you need to create a Last.fm API application:

1. Go to [Last.fm API Account](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)
2. Create a new application (any name works)
3. Copy your API Key and Shared Secret
4. Update your `.env` file:

```env
LAST_FM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LAST_FM_API_SHARED_SECRET=your_shared_secret_here
LAST_FM_APP_NAME=your_app_name
LAST_FM_APP_REGISTER=your_lastfm_username
```

The application will work without Last.fm credentials, but scrobbling will be disabled.

#### Discogs Integration

To enable automatic album artwork fetching from Discogs when building from source:

1. Go to [Discogs Developer Settings](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret
4. Update your `.env` file:

```env
DISCOGS_API_CLIENT_KEY=your_consumer_key_here
DISCOGS_API_CLIENT_SECRET=your_consumer_secret_here
```

The application will work without Discogs credentials, but automatic artwork fetching for local library will be disabled.
