# 🚀 HANDOFF: API Keys Refactor - Ready to Merge

**Date:** January 17, 2026
**Branch:** `feature/api-keys-refactor`
**Status:** ✅ Ready for merge to `main`
**Working Tree:** Clean (verified)
**New commits to merge:** 1 commit (removes API key injection from workflows)

---

## ✅ Pre-Merge Verification

```bash
# Verify current location
pwd
# Should be: /home/blitzkriegfc/Personal/qbz/qbz-worktrees/feature-api-keys-refactor

# Verify branch
git branch
# Should show: * feature/api-keys-refactor

# Verify clean state
git status
# Should show: nothing to commit, working tree clean

# Verify commits ready
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
# Should show 3 commits (1 new + 1 merge + 1 doc update)
```

**All checks passed:** ✅

---

## 🚨 POST-MERGE ACTION REQUIRED

**After merging and testing, you MUST remove the API Keys UI from Settings.**

**Why?** The UI is non-functional - it accepts user credentials but completely ignores them. All API requests go through the Cloudflare Workers proxy. Leaving this UI visible will confuse users and create unnecessary support requests.

**What to do:**
1. Merge this branch ✅
2. Test all integrations ✅
3. **Follow `POST-MERGE-CLEANUP.md`** (30-45 min, removes ~715 lines)
4. Commit the cleanup
5. Done!

**Document:** See `POST-MERGE-CLEANUP.md` for step-by-step instructions with exact line numbers.

## 🎯 Merge Commands (Copy & Paste)

### Step 1: Ensure you're in the main worktree
```bash
cd /home/blitzkriegfc/Personal/qbz/qbz-nix
```

### Step 2: Ensure main is up to date
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Merge feature branch (no fast-forward for clean history)
```bash
git merge --no-ff feature/api-keys-refactor -m "Merge feature/api-keys-refactor: Remove embedded API keys and add Discogs artwork selector

This major refactor achieves Flathub compliance by removing all embedded
API credentials from the binary. All API requests now go through a
Cloudflare Workers proxy for secure credential management.

New Features:
- Discogs artwork selection UI with multi-release support
- Catalog number support for audiophile libraries
- Carousel navigation for artwork options
- Release metadata display (title, year)

Technical Changes:
- Cloudflare Workers proxy for Last.fm, Spotify, Tidal, Discogs
- Database migration adds catalog_number column
- URI scheme registration (qbz://) for OAuth flows
- Rate limiting and User-Agent validation server-side

See CHANGELOG-api-keys-refactor.md for complete details.
See POST-MERGE-CLEANUP.md for removing legacy API Keys UI."
```

### Step 4: Resolve conflicts (if any)
```bash
# If conflicts occur (likely in SettingsView.svelte due to audio config changes)
git status
# Check which files have conflicts

# For each conflicted file:
# 1. Open in editor
# 2. Look for <<<<<<< HEAD markers
# 3. Keep BOTH changes (main's audio config + feature's other changes)
# 4. Remove conflict markers
# 5. git add <file>

# After resolving all conflicts:
git merge --continue
```

### Step 5: Push to origin
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 6: Tag the release
```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "API Keys Refactor - Flathub Compliance

Major changes:
- Removed all embedded API credentials
- Added Cloudflare Workers proxy for credential management
- Added Discogs artwork selection UI
- Added catalog number support
- Database migration for catalog_number column
- Flathub submission now possible"

git push origin v1.2.0
```

### Step 7: Cleanup (optional - can keep branch for reference)
```bash
# Delete local feature branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/api-keys-refactor

# Delete remote feature branch (optional)
git push origin --delete feature/api-keys-refactor

# Remove worktree (optional)
git worktree remove /home/blitzkriegfc/Personal/qbz/qbz-worktrees/feature-api-keys-refactor
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: API Keys UI Cleanup

**The API Keys section in Settings must be removed after merge.**

**Current State:**
- ✅ UI exists and looks functional
- ❌ User can enter credentials
- ❌ Credentials are saved to state
- ❌ **BUT credentials are completely ignored**
- ❌ All requests go through proxy (user keys never used)

**Why it's confusing to users:**
- Promises functionality that doesn't work
- Makes users think they need to configure something
- Wastes support time explaining "it doesn't actually do anything"

**Action Required:**
```bash
# After merge and testing, run:
cd /home/blitzkriegfc/Personal/qbz/qbz-nix

# Follow step-by-step instructions in:
cat POST-MERGE-CLEANUP.md

# Creates one commit removing ~715 lines of dead code
# Estimated time: 30-45 minutes
```

**What gets removed:**
- `src-tauri/src/api_keys.rs` - Entire module (175 lines)
- Settings UI section - API Keys collapsible section (~350 lines)
- Command registrations - 10 Tauri commands
- Provider parameters - Unused `ApiKeysState` params in 11 files
- Translations - API Keys strings in en.json and es.json

**Document:** `POST-MERGE-CLEANUP.md` has exact line numbers and before/after code.
