6-point roadmap for QBZ v1.0 launch - a native Qobuz client for Linux.

## 1. Session Persistence

**Status:** Completed

**Description:** Remember playback state, queue, and position when restarting the app.

**Implemented Features:**
- [x] SQLite-based session storage (~/.local/share/qbz-nix/session.db)
- [x] Position saved every 5 seconds during playback (debounced)
- [x] Full session save every 30 seconds during playback
- [x] Immediate save on pause
- [x] Volume changes persisted immediately
- [x] Shuffle/repeat mode changes persisted immediately
- [x] Queue and current track restored on login
- [x] Playback position restored accurately

**Fixed Issues (2026-01-12):**
- Fixed race condition in beforeunload (async save might not complete)
- Enabled debouncedSavePosition() which was imported but never called
- Added periodic full session save during playback
- Position now saved frequently enough that app crash loses max 5-30 seconds

## Priority Order for Remaining Work

3. **MiniPlayer** - Nice to have
4. **DLNA/AirPlay** - Lower priority
