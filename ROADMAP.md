**TODO:**
- [ ] Debug why persistence is inconsistent
- [ ] Ensure queue is always saved on app close
- [ ] Restore playback position accurately
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty queue, corrupted state file)

## Priority Order for Remaining Work

1. **Session Persistence debugging** - Critical for UX
2. **PlaylistEditModal** - Complete playlist CRUD
3. **Tray Icon** - Expected feature for music apps
4. **MiniPlayer** - Nice to have
5. **ML Suggestions** - Enhancement
6. **DLNA/AirPlay** - Lower priority
